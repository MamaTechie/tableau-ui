Tableau UI is a React component library containing UI components which have the look-and-feel of Tableau.

## Add Tableau UI

```npm install @tableau/tableau-ui```

## Using Tableau UI

If you have a Typescript project you can simply import the components and prop interfaces that you want to use, e.g.:

```import { Button, ButtonProps } from '@tableau/tableau-ui';```

Or, you could also choose to include the bundled javascript file in your web project just as you would any other javascript library. You will then be able to reference tableau-ui with the global `TableauUI` variable within your project.
